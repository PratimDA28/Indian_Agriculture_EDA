# 🌾 Indian Agriculture Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the **Indian Agriculture EDA Project**, a comprehensive analysis of agricultural trends in India. This project explores production, yield, and other key agricultural insights across different states and time periods, highlighting India's agricultural landscape.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

### 📌 Data Source
The data for this project has been sourced from trusted public datasets (from **Kaggle**). The dataset covers agricultural metrics like production, yield, and crop-specific data across various states of India.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values by either filling them contextually or dropping rows/columns.
- Removing duplicates and ensuring uniformity in state names and crop classifications.

### 📊 Data Visualization
The visualizations were created using **Plotly Express** and **Plotly Graph Objects**, enabling the development of interactive and insightful charts. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of key agricultural trends across states and time periods.

## 📚 Project Overview

This analysis dives into India's agricultural statistics and answers the following questions:

### ❓ Key Questions Answered
- Which states have the highest agricultural production values?
- How does production vary across states for different crops?
- What are the yield trends for key crops over the years?
- How do production and yield metrics correlate with each other?
- Which states contribute the most to India's food production?
- How do different states compare in terms of crop diversification?

---

## 🌟 Major Insights

- **Top Producing States**: States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal lead in agricultural production.
- **Crop-Specific Insights**: Insights were generated for specific crops (e.g., rice, wheat, sugarcane) to highlight regional specialties and trends.
- **Year-wise Trends**: Analyzed year-on-year production changes to understand the impact of climatic conditions and government policies.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Included bubble charts, bar graphs, and line plots to explore state-wise and crop-wise data effectively.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Used

- **Bubble Charts**: To visualize production by state and category.
- **Bar Charts**: For state-wise crop comparisons.
- **Line Plots**: To show trends in yield and production over time.
